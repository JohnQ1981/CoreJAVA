		/*
		 
			1) when we get "Exception" we cna handle them by throwing exceptions
			or by using "try-catch" block, But when we get "Error" we can do nothing.
			Exceptions can be handles but Errors cannot be handled.
			2) Common Errors are: 
					a) Out Of Memory Errors: it occurs when the HEAP memory is full for any reason, like infinite loop.
					b) StackOverFlow Erro: it occurs when Stack memory is full for any reason.

			
			We learned
				a)"final variable" :==>  Value Cannot be changed, must be initialized, use UpperCases
									
				b)"final method" :==> Final Method Cannot be Overridden. 
				
				c)"final class":==> Cannot be Inherited.
				
				d)"finally":==> it is used in try=catch block and it runs everytime
				
				e) finalize==> Garbage Collector scans the memory constantly. if there is 
				something to remove Java "finalizes' it first then remove it from the memory.
				finalize is a method finalize() , you can call the finalize() ify= you need but 
				JAVA runs it whenever it wants. 
			
			
			We learned a)final ==> final variable: Value cannot be changed, must be initialized, use uppercases
	            final method: Cannot be overridden
	            final class: Cannot be extended 
	      b)finally ==> It is used in try-catch block and it runs everytime 
	      c)finalize ==> Garbage Collector scans the memory constantly. If there is something 
	              to remove Java “finalizes” it first then remove it from the memory.
	              finalize is a method, you can call the finalize() if you need but Java 
	              runs it whenever it wants.
