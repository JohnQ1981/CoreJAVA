	/*

	    THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN "ABSTRACT CLASS" AND "INTERFACE"


	     1) Abstract Class = You can use "abstract" and "concrete" methods
	     	Interface      = You can just "abstract" methods, but after JAVA 8
	     					we are able to use "concrete" methods by using "default" (default methods) or "static" keywords.

	     2) Abstract Class = You can extend to abstract class, and you can implement interfaces
	     	Interface      = You can extend to interface, YOU CANNOT EXTEND/IMPLEMENT TO A CLASS.

	     3) Abstract Class = An Abstract class cannot have multiple parent class, 
	     						but it can have multiple parent interface

	     	Interface      = An interface can have multiple parent interfaces, BUT CANNOT HAVE ANY PARENT CLASS.

	     4) Abstract Class = YOU CAN USE ANY TYPE OF VARIABLES. 
	     	Interface      = ALL VARIABLE ARE "public", "final" and "static"

	     5) Abstract Class = When you create a method, you have to use "abstract" keyword, 
	     	Interface	   = When you create a method, no need to use "abstract" keyword
	     					All methods in an interface are public and abstract by default.

	     			!!! YOU CAN NOT CREATE OBJECT BY USING ABSTRACT CLASSES AND INTERFACES !!!!

	    WHAT IS THE OOP CONCEPT IN JAVA, OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMING LANGUAGE IN JAVA
	    	OOP CONCEPT HAS 4 MAIN FEATURES.

	    	1) ABSTRACTION==> Abstract Classes and Interfaces.

	    	2) ENCAPSULATION==> DATA HIDING,USING PRIVATE ACCESS MODIFIER AND  GETTER AND SETTER METHOD AND 

	    	3) INHERITANCE==> Parent-Child Relationship,

	    	4) POLYMORPHISM===> OVERRIDING(PARENT CHILD RELATIONSHIP) AND OVERLOADING ,
