 		1) Enum is like a special class. but it is not class
 		2) Enum is used to store "public", "static" ,"final" variables.
 		3) What are the differences between Enum and Class?
 			a) You cannot create object from Enums
 			b) In a class you can create every kind of variables,
 				but in Enum we can only create : public,static and final variables.
 			c) Enums cannot extend to any Class but can implement interfaces
 		4) Variable names are Typed in Upper Cases in an Enum
 			if you use multiple variables in an Enum put a comma between them
 				in Enums do not use";" when you complete a statement.
